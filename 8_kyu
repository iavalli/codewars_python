Summation
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example (Input -> Output):

2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)
"""

# Solution

def summation(num):
    result = 1
    x = 2
    while x <= num:
        result = result + x
        x = x + 1
    return result

# end of solution
